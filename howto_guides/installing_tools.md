# installation

To follow along you'll need a few tools installed. I also presume a Unix-like environment such as a GNU/Linux distribution or macOS. 

The guides presume you have the following utilities installed on your system:
- unzip
- curl
- [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/)
- [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)

## macOS

I prefer using homebrew to manage dependencies.

```
brew install nushell exiftool
```
